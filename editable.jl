#Hiking

#Gary is an avid hiker
#He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography
#During his last hike he too exactly n steps. 
#For ever step he took, he noted if it was an uphill U or downhill D step.
#Gary's hikes start and end at sea level 
#Each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude

#A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level
#starting with a step up from sea level
#ending with a step down to sea level
